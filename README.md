Calculator
==========

A rookie programming project on python by jman: "Calculator" 

A few notables are:

1. The 'gcd' function has been done by Euclidean Algorithm.
2. The '%' function is to find (calc(a, '%', c)) what percent of a is c.
3. The 'root' function is to take a root to any given variable to input 'c'.
